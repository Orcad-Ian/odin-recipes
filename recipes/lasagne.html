    <h2>A very basic lasagne cheat's recipe</h2>
    <p>This is a very simple way to make lasagne. Delia Smith would be utterly ashamed of me, and of you if you follow it.</p>
    <p class="joke">All you do is buy ready made crap from the supermarket, and shove it in the oven.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 Packet of frozen lasagne</li>
            <li>Some frozen chips</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Method</h3>    
        <ol class>
            <li>Remove the lasagne from its cardboard sleeve, leaving the foil on.</li>
            <li>Arrange the lasagne and the frozen chips on an oven tray.</li>
            <li>Put the tray in the oven at 200degC for 30 mins.</li>
            <li class="joke">Remove, dump on plate and eat while weeping silently in your shame.</li>
        </ol>
