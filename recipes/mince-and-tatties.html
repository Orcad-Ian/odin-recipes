    <h1>Mince and Tatties, a Scotsman's Favourite</h1>
    <img src="./images/mincetatties.JPG" alt="Mince and Tatties Picture" height="300" width="600">

    <h2>The favourite dish of every self-respecting Scotsman</h2>
    <p>This is just the very thing for a winter's day, or a summer's day, or even when the wife has left you.</p>
    <p class="joke">If you come from Scotland, are male, and don't like this? Then there is something badly wrong with you.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Half a pound of Mince</li>
            <li>Many Potatoes</li>
            <li>1 Onion</li>
            <li>2 Carrots</li>
            <li>Beef Stock</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Method</h3>    
        <ol class="joke">
            <li>For God's sake man, you're Scottish!</li>
            <li>You should have learned this at your mammy's knee!</li>
            <li>This is something that cannot be learned from a recipe.</li>
            <li>If you don't know now, then you never will. Your only chance at a meal lies <a href="./lasagne.html">here</a>, you poor benighted soul.</li>
        </ol>
